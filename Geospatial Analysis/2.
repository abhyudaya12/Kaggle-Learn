Many types of projections.
We use a coordinate reference system (CRS) to show how the projected points correspond to real locations on Earth.
We can findout CRS from a GeoDataFrame.
While converting dataframe to geodataframe we need to assign a crs to the geodataframe after conversion.
We can re-project which means we can change the crs using to_crs().
The Geodataframe has geometry column by which we could calculate Area too if the type is polygon.
