Can create a map in many different styles using folium package.
These maps are interactive: that means that we can move them and interact with them like zoom in, viewing markers etc.
Can add markers to map using folium.Marker
Can add markers to clusters so as to declutter the map.
We can add Bubble maps using folium.Circle() for adding circles with different colors to the map instead of markers.
We can add heatmaps to show the density of the crimes using intensity and color. folium.plugins.HeatMap()
